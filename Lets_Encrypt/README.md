I use Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/) TLS certificates for my personal sites.
These certs expire after three months, so some time back, I wrote a script to automatically
update DNS for the verification record and obtain a certificate renewal without me doing
anything but running the script.

Every three months, LE would dutifully send me an email reminding me it was soon time to renew my certsâ€”until recently. LE announced it would no longer send out emails to remind folks. Fair enough. So, I set out to write a script to check the expiration and, one week prior, perform the task automatically.

I could have created a scheduled job to run this every 90 days, but I thought this was more fun. I run it once a week.
